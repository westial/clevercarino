This repository contains the source code for my extended firmware for [OSOYOO Robot Car Starter Kit](http://osoyoo.com/2017/08/06/osoyoo-robot-car-diy-introduction/).

OSOYOO Robot Car Starter Kit is an Arduino based DIY robot with some very useful components, and this source code makes use of the following ones:

* Ultrasonic sensor.
* Servo motor to make utrasonic sensor turn sideways.
* 5 IR Track sensors.
* IR Remote Control.

## Intent ##

I called this OSOYOO smart car fork as Clevercarino: clever, car, arduino. Because if the original OSOYOO firmware is quite useful and stable, I wanted to make the robot a little smarter.

With the OSOYOO firmware, after [lesson 5](http://osoyoo.com/?p=5543) the robot can follow a black tape on floor or it can avoid obstacles, or it can be managed by a smartphone app. 

What I missed in the original firware is doing all together and get used for the real world, where there is no black tape to follow.
